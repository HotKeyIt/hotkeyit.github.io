; Changing MsgBox's Button Names
; http://www.autohotkey.com
; This is a working example script that uses a timer to change
; the names of the buttons in a MsgBox dialog. Although the button
; names are changed, the IfMsgBox command still requires that the
; buttons be referred to by their original names.
